# ML-capuchinbird-calls-prediction
- This project was done using the Z by HP Unlocked Challenge 3 - Audio Recognition dataset. Unlocked is an action-packed interactive film made by Z by HP for data scientists. The challenge is to build a ML model and code to count the number of Capuchin bird calls within a given clip. It can be utilized to find the areas in a forest where capuchin bird mostly live.
- The dataset is available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kenjee/z-by-hp-unlocked-challenge-3-signal-processing)
- Maintain the directory structure as provided below to run the script without any issue.

- Forest recording containing Capuchin bird calls. Count the number of calls from the recordings below and match the numbers with the predictions given by the trained model for that particular forest recordings.
- Number of calls predicted by model is 5.
